# ofxOpenCvContrib

openFrameworks addon for using openCv's contrib modules.

There is no code in this addon, just the openCv libraries.
This provides an easy and convenient way to add these libraries to your openFrameworks projects.

Works on Macos and should work on linux.

The macos libraries are already included. If you want to use it on Linux or update execute the install.sh script.


## Dependencies
* [ofxTbb](https://github.com/roymacdonald/ofxTbb)
 
On Macos at least, it seems like it needs the Intel Threading Building Blocks library. So you will need to download ofxTbb and put it in your addons folder.
